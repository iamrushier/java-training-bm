Stream API exercises

Task 1. Find the longest string
Given a list of string find the longest one using stream API

Task 2. Sort list in ascending/descending

Task 3. Given a list of lists of integers. Your goal is to:

1. Flatten it into a single list.
2. Remove duplicate values.

4. Sort the final list in ascending order.

Task 4. Given a list of strings. You need to:

1. Split all sentences into words.
2. Count how many times each word appears.
3. Use parallel stream to improve performance on large datasets.

Task 5. Exploring various functions in stream api
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Bob", "Alice", "Frank");
Consider above lists and perform –  
• Convert all names to uppercase.
• Count how many names start with the letter 'A'.
• Group names by their length (e.g., names of length 3, 4, etc.).
• Create a comma-separated string of all names.
• Use peek() to print each name while processing.
• Run any operation using parallel stream and show thread names via peek()
