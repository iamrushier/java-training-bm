## Java Questions

1. Write a Java program to reverse an integer. (Example: Input 1234, Output 4321).
2. Determine whether a given number or string is a palindrome (Example: 121, madam).
3. Implement a method to calculate the factorial of a given number using both recursion and iteration.
4. Print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series without using recursion.

6. Given an array, find the largest and smallest numbers without sorting.
7. Write a function to check whether a given number is prime.
8. Verify whether a number is an Armstrong number (Example: 153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153).
9. Count how many times each character appears in a string. (Example: "hello" → {h=1, e=1, l=2, o=1}).
